## Quick overview

Simple, informative public website for Andhra Polytechnic. Focus: reliability, accessibility, and minimal maintenance. No fluff — content-first pages for admissions, departments, results, news and contact.

## Tech stack

* React (component-driven UI)
* React Router (client routing)
* Swiper (sliders/carousels)
* Recharts (charts and simple visualizations)
* Node.js + npm (build tooling)

> Badges can be added later for CI, coverage and deployments.

---

## Features

* Dynamic Home: carousel, latest news, announcements
* About: accreditations, leadership, campus map, timeline
* Departments: course summaries, lab galleries
* Admissions: clear requirements and downloadable forms
* Results: fast access to exam results (PDF/list view)
* Responsive: mobile-first layout and accessible navigation

## Project status & badges

**Last commit:** 2025-08-29
**Status:** Actively maintained (frontend first) — no backend connected in this repo (if there is, document it under `backend/`).

---

## Quick start (dev)

**Prerequisites**

* Node.js (LTS) and npm

**Local dev**

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AndhraPolytechnic.git
cd AndhraPolytechnic

# install root deps (if applicable)
npm install

# install frontend deps and start dev server
npm install --prefix frontend
npm run start --prefix frontend
# or
npm run start-frontend
```


**Notes**

* Use `--prefix frontend` when root package.json delegates frontend tasks there.
* If you prefer pnpm or yarn, replace `npm install` with your package manager of choice.

---

## Build & deploy

```bash
# build production bundle
npm run build --prefix frontend
# or
npm run build-frontend

# serve build locally for verification (example using serve)
npm install -g serve
serve frontend/build
```

**Deployment**

* Static hosting (Netlify, Vercel) — point to `frontend/build` or connect the repo and set build command `npm run build --prefix frontend`.
* If a backend exists later, deploy backend separately and set environment variables for API URLs.

---

## Project structure (high level)

```
/ (repo root)
├─ frontend/          # React app
│  ├─ public/
│  ├─ src/
│  │  ├─ components/
│  │  ├─ pages/
│  │  └─ assets/
│  └─ package.json
├─ backend/ (optional) # document if present
├─ LICENSE
└─ README.md
```

---

## Scripts (common)

* `npm run start --prefix frontend` — start frontend dev server
* `npm run build --prefix frontend` — production build
* `npm run lint` — run linters (if configured)
* `npm test` — run tests (if added)

Add any custom script names you already use (e.g. `start-frontend`, `install-frontend`) to this section.

---

## Contributing — how to help (short & strict)

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/short-description`.
3. Keep commits small and focused. Use clear commit messages.
4. Push and open a PR with description, screenshot (if UI change) and testing steps.
5. Reviewer will ask for changes if needed. Don’t push half-done UI without screenshots.

**Code quality rules**

* Follow existing project style (ESLint + Prettier recommended).
* Add tests for any non-trivial logic.
* UI changes require screenshots and accessible markup (semantic tags, alt attributes).

---

## Roadmap & known issues

* Add automated CI (build + lint) — TODO
* Add live demo link and deployment pipeline — TODO
* Centralize results backend (if result uploads become frequent)
* Known issues: list anything the maintainers should expect (e.g., large image sizes, missing metadata)

---

## Screenshots & demo

Place screenshots in `/docs/screenshots/` and reference them here. Example markdown:

```md
![Home page](/docs/screenshots/home.png)
```

If you want a hosted demo, provide the URL and I’ll add a `Live demo` badge and link.

---

## Environment & secrets (if applicable)

If the app consumes an API, document the environment variables and an `.env.example` file:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL="https://api.example.com"
```

Never commit secrets.
